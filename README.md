# Lab3-Angular

The goal of this assignment is increase your familiarity with Angular in general through building a simple application. 
In this lab you will build the Tour of Heros application that comes with the main Angular tutorial.  This tutorial is well documented and will show you how to use most of the features of Angular.

The tutorial provides source code, so you can check to see where your mistakes are. 
While it is possible to copy and paste through it, 
you'll be better off if you actually type it out and work through it with the tutorial located here:
